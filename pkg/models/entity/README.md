# Summary

An entity in global joules is a container of sorts that has energy usage. The challenge in GJ is to make the entity globally meaningful.

A user can have a dwelling, which can exist in a country, state and a city in a country. The hope is that the entity manager will further and automatically
apply context to the include province, county based on the geographic labels provided by the user during registration.

In the world some societies will have users that have dwellings unlike each other, the modes of heating and cooling will not be consistent, and modes of transportation may only incur that of a user pedaling a bicycle and/or walking.
