// Political Boundaries: Political boundaries are the dividing lines between countries, states, provinces, counties, and
// cities. These lines, more often called borders, are created by people to separate areas governed by different groups. Sometimes,
// political boundaries follow physical boundaries, but most of the time you canâ€™t see them. Most maps show political boundaries.
